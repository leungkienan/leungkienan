Heyo, my name is Kienan and I'm a FullStack Developer & Accountant

I graduated from Enspiral Dev Academy, learning basic JS and dipping into React + React Native. 

As of February 2023, I've become an AWS Certified Cloud Practitioner. 

I'm currently practicing the skills I learnt from EDA and branch off into other frameworks and languages when I get more comfortable with coding 

You can reach out to me on linkedIn @kienanleung
